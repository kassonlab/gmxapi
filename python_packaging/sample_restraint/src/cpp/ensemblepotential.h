/*! \file
 * \brief Provide restrained ensemble MD potential for GROMACS plugin.
 *
 * The restraint implemented here uses a facility provided by gmxapi to perform averaging of some
 * array data across an ensemble of simulations. Simpler pair restraints can use less of this
 * example code.
 *
 * Contains a lot of boiler plate that is being generalized and migrate out of this file, but other
 * pair restraints can be implemented by following the example in this and ``ensemblepotential.cpp``.
 * The ``CMakeLists.txt`` file will need to be updated if you add additional source files, and
 * ``src/pythonmodule/export_plugin.cpp`` will need to be updated if you add or change the name of
 * potentials.
