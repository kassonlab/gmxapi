    """Execute a command line program in a subprocess.

    Configure an executable in a subprocess. Executes when run in an execution
    Context, as part of a work graph or via gmx.run().

    Subprocesses should be run in separate working directories. gmxapi 0.3.0 provisionally
    introduces a *_cwd* input to specify the working directory. The directory name should be the
    responsibility of the workflow manager and execution manager (and derived from the operation
    id, tied to fingerprinting information), but we do not currently expose resource management
    facilities to the Operation implementations.

    Shell processing is not enabled, but can be considered for a future version.
    This means that shell expansions such as environment variables, globbing (`*`),
    and other special symbols (like `~` for home directory) are not available.
    This allows a simpler and more robust implementation, as well as a better
    ability to uniquely identify the effects of a command line operation. If you
    think this disallows important use cases, please let us know.

    Arguments:
         command: a tuple (or list) to be the subprocess arguments, including *executable*
         output: mapping of command line flags to output filename arguments
         shell: unused (provides forward-compatibility)
         stdin (str): String input to send to STDIN (terminal input) of the executable.

    Multi-line text sent to *stdin* should be joined into a single string
    (e.g. ``'\n'.join(list_of_strings) + '\n'``).
    If multiple strings are provided to *stdin*, gmxapi will assume an ensemble,
    and will run one operation for each provided string.

    Only string input (:py:func:str) to *stdin* is currently supported.
    If you have a use case that requires streaming input or binary input,
    please open an issue or contact the author(s).

    Arguments are iteratively added to the command line with standard Python
    iteration, so you should use a tuple or list even if you have only one parameter.
    I.e. If you provide a string with `arguments="asdf"` then it will be passed as
    `... "a" "s" "d" "f"`. To pass a single string argument, `arguments=("asdf")`
    or `arguments=["asdf"]`.

    Example:
        Execute a command named ``exe`` that takes a flagged option for file name
        (stored in a local Python variable `my_filename`) and an `origin` flag
        that uses the next three arguments to define a vector.

            >>> my_filename = "somefilename"
            >>> result = cli(('exe', '--origin', 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, '-f', my_filename), shell=False)
            >>> assert hasattr(result, 'file')
            >>> assert hasattr(result, 'stdout')
            >>> assert hasattr(result, 'stderr')
            >>> assert hasattr(result, 'returncode')

    Returns:
        A data structure with attributes for each of the results.

    Result object attributes:
        * file: the mapping of CLI flags to filename strings resulting from the `output` kwarg
        * returncode: return code of the subprocess.
        * stderr: A string mapping from process STDERR; it will be the
                    error output (if any) if the process failed.
        * stdout: A string mapping from process STDOUT.

    # instance of an operation. However, because of the dynamic specification of
    # inputs and outputs, each invocation may have the overhead of defining new
