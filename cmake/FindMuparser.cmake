# This package tries to find an external muparser library, version
# 2.3.
#
# MUPARSER_FOUND       - muparser was found
# MUPARSER_INCLUDE_DIR - muparser include directory
# MUPARSER_LIBRARY     - muparser library
# MUPARSER_LINKS_OK    - muparser libraries link correctly
# MUPARSER_VERSION     - muparser version string as "major.minor"
#
# CMake will search the CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH in the usual way, but if you
# need more control then setting MUPARSER_INCLUDE_DIR and MUPARSER_LIBRARY
# on the cmake command line to suitable values will work.
