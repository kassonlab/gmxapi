Gromacs core module
===================

gmx.core provides Python access to the Gromacs C++ API so that client code can be
implemented in Python, C++, or a mixture. The classes provided are mirrored on the
C++ side in the gmxapi namespace.

This documentation is generated from docstrings exported by C++ extension code.

/*! \brief Export gmx.core Python module in shared object file.
 *
 * One goal of these bindings is to declare a buffer type suitable for numpy Nx3 array output.
 * If we want to pass access but not ownership to Python, we need to make
 * sure we can allow a C++ shared pointer ref count to be increased.
 * The buffer protocol requires that the exporter (this code) keeps the
 * memory valid for the exported view until all consumers are done and
 * the PyBuffer_Release(buffer *view) is issued. I'm not sure, but I assume
 * pybind11 manages that for us by holding a shared_ptr to this. However, there
 * seem to be subtleties I overlooked in some testing, so this warrants
 * further investigation.
 *
 * To be safe (and in general) we can use the keep_alive<>() call policy
 * and return_value_policy annotations.
 * The keep_alive<Nurse, Patient>() call policy keeps Patient alive as long
 * as Nurse is alive. Indices for Nurse or Patient are 0 for the return value
 * of the annotated function
 * and higher numbers for arguments. For member functions, index 1 is used
 * for the this* object.
 *
 * The pybind11 documentation notes "For functions returning smart pointers, it is not necessary to specify a return value policy."
 * and
 * "It is even possible to completely avoid copy operations with Python expressions like np.array(matrix_instance, copy = False)"
