    Example: Use ``mpiexec -n 2 python -m mpi4py myscript.py`` to run two jobs at the same time.
    In this example the jobs are identical. In myscript.py:

        >>> from gmx.data import tpr_filename # Get a test tpr filename
        >>> work = gmx.workflow.from_tpr([tpr_filename, tpr_filename])

        >>> from gmx.data import tpr_filename # Get a test tpr filename
        >>> work = gmx.workflow.from_tpr([tpr_filename, tpr_filename])

        ...    # such things.

        ...    output_path = os.path.join(context.workdir_list[rank], 'traj.trr')
        ...    assert(os.path.exists(output_path))
        ...    print('Worker {} produced {}'.format(rank, output_path))
        ...

    Implementation notes:

    To produce a running session, the Context __enter__() method is called, according to the Python context manager
    protocol. At this time, the attached WorkSpec must be feasible on the available resources. To turn the specified
    work into an executable directed acyclic graph (DAG), handle objects for the elements in the work spec are sequenced
    in dependency-compatible order and the context creates a "builder" for each according to the element's operation.
    Each builder is subscribed to the builders of its dependency elements. The DAG is then assembled by calling each
    builder in sequence. A builder can add zero, one, or more nodes and edges to the DAG.

    The Session is then launched from the DAG. What happens next is implementation-dependent, and it may take a while for
    us to decide whether and how to standardize interfaces for the DAG nodes and edges and/or execution protocols. I
    expect each node will at least have a `launch()` method, but will also probably have typed input and output ports as well as some signalling.
    A sophisticated and abstract Session implementation could schedule work only to satisfy data dependencies of requested
    output upon request. Our immediate implementation will use the following protocol.

    Each node has a `launch()` method. When the session is entered, the `launch()` method is called for each node in
    dependency order. The launch method returns either a callable (`run()` function) or None, raising an exception in
    case of an error. The sequence of non-None callables is stored by the Session. When Session.run() is called, the
    sequence of callables is called in order. If StopIteration is raised by the callable, it is removed from the sequence.
    The sequence is processed repeatedly until there are no more callables.

    Note that this does not rigorously handle races or deadlocks, or flexibility in automatically chasing dependencies. A more
    thorough implementation could recursively call launch on dependencies (launch could be idempotent or involve some
    signalling to dependents when complete), run calls could be entirely event driven, and/or nodes could "publish"
    output (including just a completion message), blocking for acknowledgement before looking for the next set of subscribed inputs.
