    A System object connects all of the objects necessary to describe a molecular
    system to be simulated.

    Once a system is created, objects can be attached or edited, accessed through
    the following properties.

    Attributes:
        workflow: element of work to be executed.

    Example:

        >>> my_sim = gmx.System._from_file(tpr_filename)
        >>> status = my_sim.run()

    Example:

        >>> my_sim = gmx.System._from_file(tpr_filename)
