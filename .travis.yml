# Different compiler or env are supposed to trigger different caches, but I had a hard time diagnosing problems
# in gromacs-gmxapi until I specified a separate ccache for each matrix build element.
# Note the heuristics for whether cache is shared or distinct:
# https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/caching/#Caches-and-build-matrices
cache:
  pip: true
  directories:
    # Note: if a cache store forks due to a stage with parallel jobs that Travis identifies as part of the same flow,
    # we must make sure that the parallel jobs do not write to any of the same caches. Also note that all stages use the
    # same cache, so early stage jobs may see caches from later stages from previous builds in the same branch.

# Allows us to build and install GROMACS in one CI stage, then use the installation in a subsequent stage
#    - $HOME/install
