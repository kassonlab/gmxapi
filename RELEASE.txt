Future release notes go here...

When a new release is about to be tagged, version and release information needs to be updated in a few places.

Once the required features in gromacs-gmxapi have been merged to its master branch, update the several lines in
.travis.yml to reference the gromacs-gmxapi release archive instead of master or a development branch.

Similarly, update the `gromacs_url` embedded in setup.py

After merging the gmxapi development branch to master and before tagging the release, 
update version.in so that it writes a version.py file with `release = True`.

Once the gmxapi gmxpy release is tagged and any touch-up commits are merged (fast-forwarded) to the refreshed
development branch,
bump the version in the development branch in CMakeLists.txt _and_ in setup.py.

If / when feature branches require new libgmxapi features, `find_package(gmxapi...` can be updated in
`src/gmx/core/CMakeLists.txt`.

As of gromacs-gmxapi 0.0.6, we are tracking compatibility more closely, and the gromacs-gmxapi 0.0.7 development branch
will claim compatibility with 0.0.6 while possible.

Note that version compatibility in find_package is handled by the installed
cmake version file of the targeted package, including handling of the `EXACT` key word, but the CMake macros used in
gromacs-gmxapi should take care of this.
